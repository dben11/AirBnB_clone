# AirBnB_clone Project
## Project Description
This is the first full web application project for every software engineering trainee at [Alx Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/). It is a hands-on practice showing the implementation of all the fudamental concepts in the Alx high-level programming track. To interact with the application we are required to build console using cmd module package.

## The Console
The console is a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface like in a shell.  
The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB).

## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
